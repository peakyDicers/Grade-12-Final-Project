# Grade-12-Final-Project

As our final project, me and two of my friends coded this single-player game for the xbox. This game can also be ran on PC, which is where we did all our testing. As the player, you must fight through waves of bad guys, with a boss at the end of the wave. My contribution in this game includes the final boss' (The Joker) AI, the projectile motion of the bomb the joker tosses, the animation of the Joker on screen, aswell as the animated main menu screen and credits roll. 

My friends and I completed this game within a month using Visual's Studio version of Git to share the same project file over the cloud. We worked at home and at school.
